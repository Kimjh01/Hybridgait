## Release
- [1/30] üî• LLaVA-NeXT (LLaVA-1.6) is out! With additional scaling to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT-34B outperforms Gemini Pro on some benchmarks. It can now process 4x more pixels and perform more tasks/applications than before. Check out the [blog post](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-01-30-llava-next/), and explore the [demo](https://llava.hliu.cc/)! Models are available in [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md). Training/eval data and scripts coming soon.
- [11/10] [LLaVA-Plus](https://llava-vl.github.io/llava-plus/) is released: Learning to Use Tools for Creating Multimodal Agents, with LLaVA-Plus (LLaVA that Plug and Learn to Use Skills). [[Project Page](https://llava-vl.github.io/llava-plus/)] [[Demo](https://llavaplus.ngrok.io/)] [[Code](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-Plus-Codebase)] [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05437)]
- [11/2] [LLaVA-Interactive](https://llava-vl.github.io/llava-interactive/) is released: Experience the future of human-AI multimodal interaction with an all-in-one demo for Image Chat, Segmentation, Generation and Editing. [[Project Page](https://llava-vl.github.io/llava-interactive/)] [[Demo](https://llavainteractive.ngrok.io/)] [[Code](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-Interactive-Demo)] [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00571)]
- [10/26] üî• LLaVA-1.5 with LoRA achieves comparable performance as full-model finetuning, with a reduced GPU RAM requirement ([ckpts](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md#llava-v15), [script](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#train)).

- [10/5] üî• LLaVA-1.5 is out! Achieving SoTA on 11 benchmarks, with just simple modifications to the original LLaVA, utilizes all public data, completes training in ~1 day on a single 8-A100 node, and surpasses methods like Qwen-VL-Chat that use billion-scale data. Check out the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744), and explore the [demo](https://llava.hliu.cc/)! Models are available in [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md). The training data and scripts of LLaVA-1.5 are released [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#train), and evaluation scripts are released [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Evaluation.md)!
- [9/26] LLaVA is improved with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve fact grounding and reduce hallucination. Check out the new SFT and RLHF checkpoints at project [[LLavA-RLHF]](https://llava-rlhf.github.io/)
- [9/22] [LLaVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485) is accepted by NeurIPS 2023 as **oral presentation**, and [LLaVA-Med](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00890) is accepted by NeurIPS 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks Track as **spotlight presentation**.
